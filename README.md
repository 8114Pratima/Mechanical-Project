# Mechanical-Project

 Some example of AI ML use case in Manufacturing Industries--
(1)Component failure prediction--
(a)In finish product(Car,Refrigerator,washing machine,lathe,Airlines)
(b)In manufacturing process- different machineries failure
(c)Preventive Maintenance 
Interesting one-- Robotics,Automation,sensor technology, IOT,Self Driven Car,Drone,High speed car,Turbine.


The design and optimization of mechanical system and parts, -->such as engines, gears and bearings
may be automated using AI.
